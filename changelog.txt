Changelog from Version 1.7 to Version 1.8:
	- Complete Re-write of the Plugin!
	- Fixed a ton of Bugs:
		- Particles and Sounds are now loaded seperated
		- Items, Particles and Sounds can앖 create Errors on loadup anymore
	- Got rid of a few unused functions and classes
	- MySQL got Removed (Buuuhuu.. :[ )
	- Added new Things to the config:
		- Update Notifications can now get turned on or off.
		- As i앏l start releasing Betas, you can now decide of you want
			to get notified on a Beta-Release
		- Adding "MainClockSpeed: <Int>" to the config, will change the speed of the main Clock
			- Default is MainClockSpeed: 50
	- Re-wrote the Reward File
		- It압 now a "fusion" of the old Reward.yml "Reward" and "Loops" part.
		- There is no need to create Loops and assign Rewards to them anymore, now its
			possible to turn Rewards directly into repeating rewards
		- Your old rewards.yml will be renamed to rewards_old.yml, the old file won앖 work with this Plugin anymore
		- The Plugin has now 3 different time count-methods: 
			- "REALTIME":
				REALTIME is like the real-world clock. It counts also if the Player or the Server is offline.
				
			- "PLAYTIME":
				PLAYTIME is the real-playtime of the Player on the Server. Just counts, while the Player is online on the Server.
				
			- "SESSIONTIME":
				SESSIONTIME is similiar to PLAYTIME, except it gets reset to 0 if the Player disconnects. This means it just counts the
				Playtime of the Player of the actual "session".
			- Define these in the "CountType" Field for each Reward
			
Changelog to Version 2.1:
	- Fixed a few issues with data/pathfinding.

		- Default is DebugMode: false
		- Isn앖 visible in the default config, can be pasted in.
	- Added the config Value Main.ForceCommands: <Boolean>
		- If another Plugin uses the same Commands than Playtimerewards and ForceCommands is set to false, PlaytimeRewards 
			ignores the Command
		- If another Plugin uses the same Commands than Playtimerewards and ForceCommands is set to true, PlaytimeRewards 
			tries to deny the Command for the other Plugin
		-Is for default set to ForceCommands: false

	- Added the config value Main.vanillaPlaytime <boolean>, it tells the Plugin if it should count the Playtime 
		for itself or if it should use Minecrafts playtime-counter
		-is useful, if you got some Players which played before this Plugin was installed, as minecraft counted their Playtime
			all the time.
